# Phenotypes Modelling

Code for manuscript ""

Allows modelling of phenotype determination using a 3d agent-based, multiscale tumour and tumour microenvironment model matched to the PDE Model as in Villa et al. 2021. C++ code couples agent-based model for cancer cells and blood vessels with finite element solver (FreeFem++) for diffusion of oxygen
