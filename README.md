# VirtualTumour

3d agent-based, multiscale tumour and tumour microenvironment model

C++ code for coupling of agent-based model for cancer cells, blood vessels and ECM with finite element solver (FreeFem++) for diffusive components (e.g. oxygen)

Interactions between cells, vessels and ECM fibres are chemical and mechanical
